  - ' For all of the wild-eyed (and completely sectarian) assertions floating around
    the LCMS that ordination is a mere adiaphoron, that "laying on of hands" does
    not mean ritual ordination but rather a democratic election, that ordination confers
    nothing - I have yet to ever read about anyone actually graduating seminary and
    taking a call to a congregation and choosing to forgo the rite of ordination.'

  definitions:
  - (mechanics) Motion with a continually decreasing velocity.
  entries:
  - decelerated motion
  examples:
  - From this it becomes clear that the doubly decelerated motion may be constructed
    either by subtracting a simply accelerated motion from a simply decelerated one,
    or by subtracting a doubly accelerated motion from a uniform one.

  definitions:
  - (mechanics) Motion with a constant, continually decreasing velocity.
  entries:
  - uniformly decelerated motion
  examples:
  - Read from bottom to top, it represents the overall distances traversed by a uniformly
    decelerated motion after an increasing number of equal time intervals.

92443558-n:
  definitions:
  - (mechanics) any motion whose acceleration is not constant, due to the fact that
    the force causing it is not constant.
  entries:
  - motion with variable acceleration
  examples:
  - Time-varying net force must be present to cause motion with variable acceleration
    along that one coordinate.
